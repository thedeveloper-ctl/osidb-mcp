_READONLY_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
This server exposes read-only OSIDB operations (flaws/CVEs, affects, trackers, comments, references, CVSS) \
via official osidb-bindings. Responses may include embargoed data depending on your OSIDB account.

Flaw payloads include a stable ``uuid`` from OSIDB. When ``cve_id`` is missing or not yet assigned, use that \
``uuid`` as ``flaw_id`` for retrieve/subresource tools, and use ``flaw_uuid`` / ``affects_flaw_uuid`` on list APIs \
for affects and trackers (see tool descriptions).

Use high-level tools ``search_flaws``, ``get_flaw_details``, and ``get_cve_summary`` for triage-style search and rollups; \
use lower-level ``flaws_list`` / ``flaws_count`` when you need full filter control.
"""

This server is running in **readwrite** mode. Mutation tools (``flaw_create``) are available in addition to \
all read-only tools. Write operations contact OSIDB and create real data; treat transcripts accordingly.
